# Encrypted Communication

This python script is a simple app that helps you communicate with your friends.

What it does is create a private and a public pgp key pair stored in the project root directory. This chat works based on your email addresses and the corresponding private key. If you do not have one of those, the app is useless. Even if someone knows your email address, he cannot see your messages.
